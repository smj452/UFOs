# UFO Sightings Webpage

## Overview of Project

## Summary

One of the drawbacks of this new design is that users need to know the exact abbreviation to filter the city state and country. There is no drop down option that pops up with the available filters.
Also the user has to manually enter the date in the search field.There is no calendar pop-up option for the date filter. 


### Recommendations for Further Development.

- Provide a dropdown of all the available filter options. Also include a date calender pop-up for date filter field. Adding this would help user to enter dates in the correct format and avoid any manual error.
- Add the "Clear Filters" button to clear and reset the filter.
